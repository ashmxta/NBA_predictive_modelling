# ECE324: NBA Game Predictions

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict NBA game outcomes (win, loss) using models like MLPs, 1-D CNNs and LSTMs. The goal is to create accurate predictions to inform betting decisions while considering ethical concerns.

## Features

- Predict game outcomes.
- Utilize team stats, player metrics, and contextual data.
- Benchmark against sportsbooks and expert predictions.

## Data Sources (Web-scraping)

- [NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats)
- [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com)

## Data sets
- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eoinamoore/historical-nba-data-and-player-box-scores?resource=download

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather stats using web scraping and APIs.
2. **Modeling**: Train MLPs and LSTM models.
3. **Evaluation**: Compare predictions with sportsbook odds and real-world outcomes.

## Goals
