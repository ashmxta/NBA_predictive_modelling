# ECE324: NBA Game Predictions

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict NBA game outcomes (win, loss, tie) using models like logistic regression and LSTMs. The goal is to create accurate predictions to inform betting decisions while considering ethical concerns.

## Features

- Predict game outcomes with probabilities.
- Utilize team stats, player metrics, and contextual data.
- Benchmark against sportsbooks and expert predictions.

## Data Sources (Web-scraping)

- [NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats)
- [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com)

## Data sets
- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eoinamoore/historical-nba-data-and-player-box-scores?resource=download

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather stats using web scraping and APIs.
2. **Modeling**: Train logistic regression and LSTM models.
3. **Evaluation**: Compare predictions with sportsbook odds and real-world outcomes.

## Goals

- Predict tournament winners and individual player performances.
- Provide real-time predictions with up-to-date data.

## Tools

- Python, PyTorch, Sci-kit Learn

## Literature Review + 324 Course notes
The resource below consists of a literature review of model architectures used as well as notes from ECE324 lectures - these helped inform our architecture choices.
